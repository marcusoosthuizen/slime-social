# Slime Social

Slime Social is a now defunct chatroom game / website that I made in highschool. This repo contains the source code for all versions of this project

There are four versions:
- slime-social-game - the first version of the game (Edit udp:setpeername in main.lua to the ip of the computer running the server file)
- slime-social-game-rewrite - a incomplete rewrite of the first game (udp:setpeername can be found in networking.lua)
- slime-social - the first version of the slime social website (run index.html and the server file on the same machine)
- new-slime-social - the final version and rewrite of the website (build it using svelte, apart from that I can't remember how it worked at all)
